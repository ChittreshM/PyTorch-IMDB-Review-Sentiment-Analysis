# PyTorch-IMDB-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

# Project Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using PyTorch and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The model is trained on the IMDB movie review dataset, classifying reviews as positive or negative.

This will train the model and save the trained weights as sentiment_lstm.pth.

# Testing the Model

Run the test script to classify new movie reviews:

# Model Architecture

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vector representations.

LSTM Layer: Captures sequential patterns in text.

Fully Connected Layer: Outputs a single value (sigmoid activation) for classification.

# Results & Accuracy

The model is trained for 5 epochs with batch size = 32.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Loss.
